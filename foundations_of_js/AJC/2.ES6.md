## Overview

This concept will help you understand ECMAScript 6 i.e the stable newer version of JavaScript

## Learning Outcome

- What is ECMAScript 6 (ES6)?
- Why should one learn ES6?
- What are the new features that ES6 provides?


### ECMAScript 6

ECMA stand for  **European Computer Manufacturer Association**. ECMA is the association that puts out the guidelines for JavaScript in all browsers. I will cover the history of Javascript and creation of ECMA before I go into detail on ES6 features .

#### History

-   1995 — Javascript was created.
-   1997 — ECMAscript 1
-   ECMAScript 2–3 are aboned within a few years after ES1, not as important since ES5 eclipsed the other version.
-   ES4 — abandoned.
-   2009 — ES5 is released. Brought forEach, map, and filter to JS.
-   2015 — ES6 specs are released

In short, ECMA(Script) is the association that provides the guidelines for what all browsers should support as well as provide new features that are available in JavaScript.

**NOTE**: just because new guidelines are released it does not mean that all browsers support the new features released.  [**_Compatibility Click Here._**](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/)

#### Transpiling with Babel

Since not all browsers support ES6 you may need to transpile your code from ES6 to ES5 so your code will be read by more browsers. Transpiling is also used for CoffeeScript and TypeScript.

Babel does the transpiling in order for your browser to render appropriately. Babel is the most popular transpiler since it supports the most amount of browsers.

-   Babel was created by Sebastian Mckenzie (worked at fb).
-   Babel is frequently used with React which was developed by FaceBook.

#### What you must do?

- Install Node.js that's compatible with your operating system [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Read about [babel & javascript bundlers](https://medium.com/backticks-tildes/introduction-to-babel-and-javascript-bundlers-fe6165de197c)

### ECMAScript 6 - Async / Await
The async function declaration defines an asynchronous function, which returns an AsyncFunction object.
When an async function is called, it returns a Promise.

When the async function returns a value, the Promise will be resolved with the returned value. When the async function throws an exception or some value, the Promise will be rejected with the thrown value.

An async function can contain an await expression, that pauses the execution of the async function and waits for the passed Promise's resolution, and then resumes the async function's execution and returns the resolved value.

### Assessment Quiz
1. `let` declares a block-scoped variable
- `false`  
- `true`  [Correct Answer]

2. What is the final value of  `obj`  in the following example?

```js
const obj = { foo: 1 }

obj = { bar: 2 }
```
- `{foo: 1}`  
- `{foo: 1, bar: 2}`
- `{bar: 2}`  
- `Throws error` [Correct Answer]



3. What is the final value of  `obj`  in the following example?

```js
const obj = { foo: 1 }

obj.bar = 2
```
- `{foo: 1}`  
- `{foo: 1, bar: 2}` [Correct Answer]
- `{bar: 2}`  
- `Throws error`


4. What is the result of the following?

```
const speed = 'quick'

`The ${speed} brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.`
```
- `The quick brown fox jusmps over the lazy dog.`  [Correct Answer]
- `Type error`  
- `Syntax error`  
- `The ${speed} brown fox jusmps over the lazy dog.`

5. Which of the following statements is  _not true_  about this example?

```js
const obj = {
  outer: function() {
    const self1 = this

    function inner1() {
      const self2 = this

      function inner2() {
        const self3 = this
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- `self1 !== self3`
- `self2 !== self3`
- `self1 === self2` [Correct answer]
- `self2 !== self3`
