## Overview

JavaScript is huge. Pat yourself at the back for having reached this far. The course was broken into the essentials and the advanced JS concepts being used by the Industry. In this section, we'll be exploring the Advanced concepts of data structures that simplifies JS and provides more power to the developer.

## Learning Outcome

- What are the advanced concepts of handling data structures?


### Advanced Data Structure
In addition to having aesthetic understanding of HTML and CSS, Frontend Engineers are expected to master JavaScript as well. As datastores on the client become “replicas” of databases on the server, intimate knowledge of idiomatic data structures becomes pivotal. In fact, an engineer’s level of experience can be inferred from his or her ability to distinguish  _when_  and  _why_  to use a particular data structure.
