## Assignment: Auto Image Slider

### Problem Statement
##### Task 1
Make a request using `fetch() API` to [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos) to retrieve an array of photo detail objects. Click on the link to see the sample response. It should be an array of photo detail objects.

##### Task 2
In this response, you will see properties with the name **'title', 'url', 'thumbnailUrl', etc.** Reduce the **size of the response array** to the top five photo details.

##### Task 3
Create an animated image slider which auto slides in every 5 seconds using the **reduced response array**. The slider should look similar to the image provided in the link: [https://www.jqueryscript.net/images/Basic-Thumbnail-Image-Slider-Plugin-with-jQuery-Thumb-slider.jpg](https://www.jqueryscript.net/images/Basic-Thumbnail-Image-Slider-Plugin-with-jQuery-Thumb-slider.jpg)

Apply some random CSS animation of your choice on image slide in and out.

##### Task 4
Render the title, url and thumbnail url of the active slide under the Image Slider. On slide change, it should render the previously mentioned properties of the next active slide.

##### Task 5
User should be able to slide the images using the arrow keys (<- / ->). On using the navigational arrow keys, the auto slide should stop. The user should be given complete control.

### Input
Photo details from [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos) API.

### Output
Animated Image Slider

### Constraints
 - Use the `fetch()` API for API call.
 - Use jQuery for DOM manipulation
 - Use lodash once for any array/object manipulation.
 - Try to use as many features as you can from ES6 concepts you learnt
