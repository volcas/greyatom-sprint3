## Overview

This concept will help you understand Inheritance in JS and the infamous `this` keyword

## Learning Outcome

- How does Inheritance work in JS?
- What does the 'this' keyword do?


### Inheritance in JS
Inheritance is an important concept in object oriented programming. In the classical inheritance, methods from base class get copied into derived class.

In JavaScript, inheritance is supported by using prototype object. Some people call it "Prototypal Inheriatance" and some people call it "Behaviour Delegation".
