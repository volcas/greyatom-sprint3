### Build an Instagram clone  (40 hours)
#### Overview
If you think of any web page you interact with today, JavaScript is most likely providing the action on the page. JavaScript can be used to change the status of a button when it is clicked on, create a chat window at the bottom of your screen, or even create a web-based game. With modern tools like [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), JavaScript can now also be used to save data to a database or to create desktop applications. The applications are limitless, and we're excited to see what you'll create. Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three major tools you'll need to understand if you want to build a modern website.

From  [W3C](https://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/A_Short_History_of_JavaScript):

> JavaScript, not to be confused with Java, was created in 10 days in May 1995 by Brendan Eich, then working at Netscape and now of Mozilla. JavaScript was not always known as JavaScript: the original name was Mocha, a name chosen by Marc Andreessen, founder of Netscape. In September of 1995 the name was changed to LiveScript, then in December of the same year, upon receiving a trademark license from Sun, the name JavaScript was adopted. This was somewhat of a marketing move at the time, with Java being very popular around then.
