This concept will help you understand AJAX

## Learning Outcome

- What is AJAX?
- What purpose does AJAX serve?
- What is REST?
- What is the Fetch API?


### REST

REST stands for **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer.

It means when a RESTful API is called, the server will _transfer_ to the client a _representation_ of the _state_ of the requested resource.

For example, when a developer calls Instagram API to fetch a specific user (the resource), the API will return the state of that user, including their name, the number of posts that user posted on Instagram so far, how many followers they have, and more.

The representation of the state can be in a JSON format, and probably for most APIs this is indeed the case. It can also be in XML, HTML format or based on what the user wants to request from the server.

### AJAX & Promises

AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a mechanism through which web applications can send and retrieve data from a [server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server "Web server") asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows web pages and, by extension, web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. In practice, modern implementations commonly utilize [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON "JSON") instead of XML.

#### What you must do?

- As discussed, understand [what is AJAX?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l13qGLTgNw)
- Watch this video and code along to understand [JSON and AJAX with real examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJesac0_Ftw)
- Read about [JS Promises](https://www.macadamian.com/learn/javascript-promises-explained/)

### Fetch API

`fetch()` allows you to make network requests similar to XMLHttpRequest (XHR). The main difference is that the Fetch API uses Promises, which enables a simpler and cleaner API, avoiding callback hell and having to remember the complex API of XMLHttpRequest.
