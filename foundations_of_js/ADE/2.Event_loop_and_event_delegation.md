## Overview

This concept will help you understand Events, event loops and event delegation.

## Learning Outcome

- What is a JS event?
- What is an event loop?
- What is event delegation?


### Events
JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when the user or the browser manipulates a page.

When the page loads, it is called an event. When the user clicks a button, that click too is an event. Other examples include events like pressing any key, closing a window, resizing a window, etc.

Developers can use these events to execute JavaScript coded responses, which cause buttons to close windows, messages to be displayed to users, data to be validated, and virtually any other type of response imaginable.

Events are a part of the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 and every HTML element contains a set of events which can trigger JavaScript Code.

#### What you must do?

- Go through the [examples](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_events_examples.asp) to learn about various events.
- Read about [JS event listener](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_eventlistener.asp). Using this, you do not have explicitly define the event in html tags. Instead you can do it within your JS code.

### Event loop

The **event loop** is the secret behind JavaScriptâ€™s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.

#### What you must do?

- Answer to [what the heck is the event loop anyway?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ)
- Read about [JS timing events](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_timing.asp)

### Event Delegation

Event delegation allows you to avoid adding event listeners to specific element like `<p>`; instead, the event listener is added to one parent. That event listener analyzes bubbled events to find a match on child elements.

#### What you must do?

- Watch a video on [Event Propagation (w Bubbling and Capturing)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtOrr7oTH_8) for understanding the concept in depth.
