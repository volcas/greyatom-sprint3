### Flow Of Control

Control flow or more appropriately phrased as flow of control is the order in which parts of a program are executed usually in response to the conditional statements such as `if` statements but may also include unconditional changes in flows for example, goto statements.  

Typical flows are:
1) sequential in which statements are executed one after another  
2) loops where certain processes are iterated  
3) branches where flow is transferred based on an existing condition at time of execution.

#### What you must do?

*Onboarding*

- Read about [if..else condition](https://javascript.info/ifelse).
- Read about the [switch statement](https://javascript.info/switch).

- Try to understand [loops](https://medium.com/@js_tut/the-complete-guide-to-loops-cfa6522157e9) in detail. The link is a complete guide to the looping mechanisms available in JavaScript.

### Error handling in JS

No matter how great we are at programming, sometimes our scripts have errors. They may occur because of our mistakes, an unexpected user input, an erroneous server response and for a thousand other reasons.

Usually, a script “dies” (immediately stops) in case of an error, printing it to console.

But there’s a syntax construct  `try..catch`  that allows to “catch” errors and, instead of dying, do something more reasonable.

### Assessment Quiz

1. What would be an answer if the below-given code is executed?

```js
var hungerLevel = 10;

if (hungerLevel > 7); {
  console.log("Time to eat!");
} else (hungerLevel < 7) {
  console.log("Lets\'s eat later.");
}

console.log('Hey');
```

- `Time to eat`
- `Syntax error` [Correct Answer]
- `Let's eat later`
- `Hey`

2. Consider the following code:

```js
for (var x = 0; x < 26; x+=5) {  
  if (x == 10) continue;

  document.write(x + "<br/>");  
}  
```

How many lines will this statement output to the document?
- `3`
- `1`
- `5` [Correct Answer]
- `10`

3. Consider the following code:  

```js  
var season = 5;  
var seasonName = "Summer";  
switch (season) {  
  case(1):  
    seasonName = "Winter";  
    break;  
  case(2):  
	seasonName = "Spring";  
	break;  
  case(3):  
	seasonName = "Summer";  
	break;  
  case(4):  
	seasonName = "Fall";  
	break;  
  default:  
	seasonName = "Unknown";  
}  
```  

What is the value of seasonName after execution?

- `Summer`
- `Unknown` [Correct Answer]
- `Spring`
- `Fall`

4. Consider the following code:  

```js  
var x = 100;  
while (x > 5) {  
x--;  
}  
```  

What will be the value of x after execution?

- `4`
- `5` [Correct Answer]
- `6`
- `-1`

5.  
Consider the following code:  

```js  
var x = 0;  
while (x < 10){  
document.write(x);  
}  
```

How many times will this statement execute?
- Until the browser is closed   [Correct Answer]
- Syntax error
- type error
-  Once
