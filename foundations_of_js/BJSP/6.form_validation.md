### Form Validation

Forms are used in webpages for the user to enter their required details that are further sent to the server for processing. A form is also known as web form or HTML form. Examples of form use are prevalent in e-commerce websites, online banking, online surveys, etc. to name a few.

Form validation normally used to occur at the server, after the client had entered all the necessary data and then pressed the Submit button. If the data entered by a client was incorrect or was simply missing, the server would have to send all the data back to the client and request that the form be resubmitted with correct information. This was really a lengthy process which used to put a lot of burden on the server.

JavaScript provides a way to validate form's data on the client's computer before sending it to the web server. Form validation generally performs two functions.

-   **Basic Validation**  − First of all, the form must be checked to make sure all the mandatory fields are filled in. It would require just a loop through each field in the form and check for data.

-   **Data Format Validation**  − Secondly, the data that is entered must be checked for correct form and value. Your code must include appropriate logic to test correctness of data.
