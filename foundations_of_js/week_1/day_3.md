## AJAX (Promises) & DOM Events (ADE): Intro (10 min)
#### Overview
**DOM (Document Object Model) events** are an actions that occurs as a result of the user action or as result of state change of the elements of a [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) tree.

Examples of HTML DOM events:
-   When a user clicks the mouse
-   When a web page has loaded
-   When an image has been loaded
-   When the mouse moves over an element
-   When an input field is changed
-   When an HTML form is submitted
-   When a user strokes a key

AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a mechanism through which web applications can send and retrieve data from a [server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server "Web server") asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows web pages and, by extension, web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. In practice, modern implementations commonly utilize [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON "JSON") instead of XML.
