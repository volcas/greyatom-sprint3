### Why to do this

JavaScript has emerged as one of the most popular programming languages in the world, reigning at **#1** on GitHub in terms of pull requests in 2017. The language plays a major role on the web and because of its ease of use and speed, more developers are starting to use JavaScript on the backend via the Node.js framework.

JavaScript allows developers to add interactive effects to web pages. It often works alongside HTML, but it’s becoming more common for web apps to be built entirely in JavaScript.

[Because of its simplicity and speed](https://dzone.com/articles/why-javascript-and-will), more startups and tech businesses are starting to use JavaScript on the frontend and backend.



## Concept 1: Basics of JS programming

### Introduction
If you think of any web page you interact with today, JavaScript is most likely providing the action on the page. JavaScript can be used to change the status of a button when it is clicked on, create a chat window at the bottom of your screen, or even create a web-based game. With modern tools like [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), JavaScript can now also be used to save data to a database or to create desktop applications. The applications are limitless, and we're excited to see what you'll create. Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three major tools you'll need to understand if you want to build a modern website.

From  [W3C](https://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/A_Short_History_of_JavaScript):

> JavaScript, not to be confused with Java, was created in 10 days in May 1995 by Brendan Eich, then working at Netscape and now of Mozilla. JavaScript was not always known as JavaScript: the original name was Mocha, a name chosen by Marc Andreessen, founder of Netscape. In September of 1995 the name was changed to LiveScript, then in December of the same year, upon receiving a trademark license from Sun, the name JavaScript was adopted. This was somewhat of a marketing move at the time, with Java being very popular around then.

### Assignment

- **Remove Duplicate**
	- Given an array of numbers with duplicate values, write a function to return an array of unique numbers
	- **Input**: [1, 9, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 5, 6, 6, 9]
	- **Output**: [1, 9, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
- **Quiz**
	- In your code, Create an array of Objects with 3 properties i.e question, answer, options e.g
		- [ { question: 'What is the capital of India?', answer: 'Delhi', options: [ 'Mumbai', 'Delhi', 'Gujarat' ]}, ...so on ]
	- As shown in the example, create ten such objects witj different questions, answers and options.
	- On the webpage, user should see an header saying **Take the Quiz**
	- Beneath the header, place the one quiz question with options at a time.
	- On answering the first question, the first question should slide out and the second question should slide in.
	- The above will continue until all the questions are answered by the user.
	- Once the user has answered all the question, show the list of questions with the answers provided by the user alongside the right answer.
	- A section containing
	- **Input**: [ { question: 'What is the capital of India?', answer: 'Delhi', options: [ 'Mumbai', 'Delhi', 'Gujarat' ]}, ...so on ]
	- **Output**: Answer to the questions
- **Auto Image Slider**
	- Create an animated image slider which slides in every 5 seconds
	- Every image should have an description. Render the descript of the active slide in the bottom.
	- Description changes on slide change.
	- The slider should look similar to the image providedin the link: [https://www.jqueryscript.net/images/Basic-Thumbnail-Image-Slider-Plugin-with-jQuery-Thumb-slider.jpg](https://www.jqueryscript.net/images/Basic-Thumbnail-Image-Slider-Plugin-with-jQuery-Thumb-slider.jpg)

## Concept 2: AJAX (Promises) & DOM Events

### Introduction
**DOM (Document Object Model) events** are an actions that occurs as a result of the user action or as result of state change of the elements of a [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) tree.

Examples of HTML DOM events:
-   When a user clicks the mouse
-   When a web page has loaded
-   When an image has been loaded
-   When the mouse moves over an element
-   When an input field is changed
-   When an HTML form is submitted
-   When a user strokes a key

AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a mechanism through which web applications can send and retrieve data from a [server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server "Web server") asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows web pages and, by extension, web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. In practice, modern implementations commonly utilize [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON "JSON") instead of XML.

### Assignment

- **Javascript pagination**
	- Make an API call to [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1/posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1/posts)
	- Example for making an API [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
	- You should receive a certain number of posts in an array.
	- Your code should generate links to record sets depending on the total number of items in the array divided by recordset
	-   For eg. if you have 90 posts in the array and your recordset per page is set to 10, than it should generate 9 links with numbers 1 to 9
	- Links are nothing but horizontally equidistant clickable numbers
	- Clicking on each number should load the recordset accordingly for eg. if I click on number ‘5’ it should load recordset from 41-50 on the page
	-  The API provides a property named title.
	-  List the titles above the pagination section. The list should changing on pressing the clickable recordset e.g 5 in our case
	-   It should also apply some style to the current recordset number
	-  Generate ‘Next’ and ‘Previous’ links along with the numbers
	-  Cliking on ‘Next’ and ‘Previous’ should switch to next and previous record set
	-   It should also switch the active link while switching recordsets
	-   Previous should only come when you are not on first recordset
	-   Next should disappear when you are on last recordset
	-   Finally generate a select element (dropdown) with number of pages and update the recordset when the user changes the number in this
	- What's pagination?
